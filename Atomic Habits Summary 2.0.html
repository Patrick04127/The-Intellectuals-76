  <h2 class="heading-2">Top three lessons from the book!</h2>

  <h2 class="lesson-1">Lesson 1</h2>

  <p class="paragraph-2">
    Small habits make a big difference It is so easy to overestimate the
    importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making
    small improvements on a daily basis. Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t
    particularly notable— sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far
    more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny
    improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out:
    if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up
    thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1
    percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero.
    What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something
    much more. It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right
    now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward
    success. Focus on getting 1 percent better every day.

<h2 class="lesson-2">Lesson 2</h2>

  <p class="paragraph-3">
    Forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. Goals are about
    the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead
    to those results. If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem
    isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again
    and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the
    wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You
    fall to the level of your systems. Atomic Habits presents a proven system
    for building good habits and breaking bad ones.

  <h2 class="lesson-3">Lesson 3</h2>

  <p class="paragraph-4">
    Build identity-based habits The key to building lasting habits is focusing
    on creating a new identity first. Your current behaviors are simply a
    reflection of your current identity. What you do now is a mirror image of
    the type of person you believe that you are (either consciously or
    subconsciously). To change your behavior for good, you need to start
    believing new things about yourself. You need to build identity-based
    habits. Changing your beliefs isn’t nearly as hard as you might think. There
    are two steps. Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to
    yourself with small wins. Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every
    action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

  <p class="paragraph-5">
    This section of the Atomic Habits summary presents key points from the
    actionable strategies in the book, organized around a framework called the
    Four Laws of Behavior Change. The process of building a habit can be divided
    into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. Breaking it down
    into these fundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it
    works, and how to improve it. The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a
    response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and,
    ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form
    a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving,
    response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This
    cycle is known as the habit loop. We can transform these four steps into a
    practical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad
    ones. The framework is called the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and it
    provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad
    ones.
