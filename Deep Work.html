            <h2>Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</h2>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                In *Deep Work*, Cal Newport argues that the ability to focus deeply on cognitively demanding tasks is a superpower in today’s world. He contrasts "deep work" (focused, undistracted, high-value work) with "shallow work" (email, social media, low-value tasks). The book provides practical strategies for cultivating deep focus and maximizing productivity.
